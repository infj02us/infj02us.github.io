We modernize the original DeltaNet with several key architectural improvements. The overall model structure follows Llama's design, alternating between a token mixer (DeltaNet instead of self-attention) and a channel mixer (SwiGLU). Within the DeltaNet layer, queries and keys share the same processing pipeline: Linear → ShortConv → SiLU → L2Norm, while values follow Linear → ShortConv → SiLU, and the beta term is computed through Linear → Sigmoid. Let's examine the motivation behind each of these design choices.


### Normalization on transition matrices

A crucial aspect of DeltaNet's architecture is the normalization of key vectors. This isn't just a technical detail - it's fundamental to the model's stability and effectiveness. Consider DeltaNet's core equation:

$$ \mathbf{S}_{t} = \mathbf{S}_{t-1} (\mathbf{I} - \beta_t \mathbf{k}_t\mathbf{k}_t^\top) + \mathbf{v}_t\mathbf{k}_t^\top$$

The stability of this recurrent system depends on the eigenvalues of its transition matrix $$(\mathbf{I} - \beta_t \mathbf{k}_t\mathbf{k}_t^\top)$$. This matrix has an elegant spectral structure:
- The eigenvalue in the direction of $$\mathbf{k}_t$$ is $$1 - \beta_t\|\mathbf{k}_t\|^2$$
- All directions perpendicular to $$\mathbf{k}_t$$ have eigenvalue 1

For stable updates, we need all eigenvalues to have magnitude $$\leq 1$$. Given $$0 \leq \beta_t \leq 1$$, this requires $$\|\mathbf{k}_t\|^2 \leq 2$$. While the original DeltaNet used L1 normalization, we found L2 normalization offers both better empirical performance and a more intuitive geometric interpretation: when $$\beta_t = 1$$ and $$\|\mathbf{k}_t\|_2 = 1$$, the matrix $$\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{k}_t\mathbf{k}_t^\top$$ becomes a projection matrix that selectively erases information in the direction of $$\mathbf{k}_t$$ while preserving all other directions.

We also found that L2 normalization on queries improves performance, possibly related to the success of QK-normalization in recent attention models.

### Activation Function Choice

Our experiments show SiLU activation performs slightly better than alternatives like ReLU and 1+ELU. This presents an interesting contrast with traditional linear attention mechanisms, where activation functions are typically chosen to ensure positive attention scores through positive feature maps. SiLU's ability to produce negative values actually appears beneficial in our case. This aligns with recent findings from works like Differential Transformers that demonstrate the value of allowing negative attention scores - suggesting that restricting attention to be strictly positive might be unnecessarily limiting. 


### The Critical Role of Short Convolution

Short convolution has emerged as a crucial component in recent subquadratic attention models, appearing in various forms across architectures like Mamba, xLSTM, and MetaLA. This pattern echoes earlier innovations like the "shift-SSM" in H3 and "token-shift" in RWKV. Our analysis reveals that DeltaNet similarly relies heavily on short convolution operations to enhance its performance. We can understand this dependency through the theoretical framework of Neural Turing Machines (NTM).
To appreciate this connection, let's first consider how NTMs handle information access. NTMs identified two fundamental addressing mechanisms: content-based addressing (finding information based on what it contains) and position-based addressing (accessing information based on where it's located). DeltaNet's core operation centers on content-based addressing, implemented through its state update rule:
$$\mathbf{S}t = \mathbf{S}{t-1}(\mathbf{I} - \beta_t\mathbf{k}_t\mathbf{k}_t^\top) + \beta_t\mathbf{v}_t\mathbf{k}_t^\top$$
This update mechanism allows DeltaNet to locate and modify information based on key similarity, analogous to how NTM's content addressing locates memory locations with similar content. While the sequential nature of these updates makes the system inherently order-sensitive (as each update affects the state seen by subsequent operations), the primary mechanism still operates through content similarity rather than explicit positional information.

However, many patterns in sequence processing require precise positional relationships. The NTM recognized this need and introduced convolution-based position addressing as a complementary mechanism to its content addressing. This allowed the NTM to shift attention by exact positions relative to its current focus, enabling operations like "move one step left" or "copy the next three elements."

Short convolution in DeltaNet serves a similar purpose - it provides deterministic access to recent positions, independent of content. This position-based addressing is essential for tasks like forming induction heads within a single layer, where a model needs to identify and copy patterns from specific relative positions (like "A B A B A ..."). While DeltaNet's content-based mechanism could theoretically learn such patterns, having direct positional access through convolution makes this much more reliable.

Think of content addressing as finding information by what it contains (like looking up a topic in a book's index) versus position addressing as finding information by where it sits (like knowing exactly which page to turn to). Both capabilities are necessary: content addressing for flexible, semantic relationships, and position addressing for precise, structural patterns. This duality, first recognized in the NTM's design, remains crucial for modern architectures like DeltaNet.
