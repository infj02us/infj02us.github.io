      abstract={In empirical research, this article uses daily climate data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States to construct a temperature box with a range of 5℃, focusing on analyzing the impact of extreme high temperatures ($>$30℃) and extreme low temperatures ($\le$-10℃) on the asset value of enterprises. The results based on panel regression model show that extreme high and low temperatures can significantly reduce the asset value of enterprises. In the robustness test, this article used lagged climate data for testing, and the results still showed that extreme high temperatures had a significant negative impact on the asset value of enterprises, verifying the reliability of the benchmark regression results.
In depth heterogeneity analysis shows that in the process of addressing climate risks, companies exhibit significant differentiation based on different ownership types and industry characteristics. According to research, state-owned enterprises are relatively less affected by extreme weather due to their resource advantages and policy preferences. In addition, foreign-funded enterprises demonstrate a high level of risk resistance due to their strong management efficiency and supply chain control capabilities. In the manufacturing sector, heavy industries such as steel and communication manufacturing are particularly affected by the negative effects of extreme weather, which fully demonstrates that these industries face more severe challenges when dealing with extreme weather conditions.}

      abstract={In order to explore whether environmental liability insurance has an important impact on industrial emission reduction, this paper selects provincial (city) level panel data from 2010 to 2020 and constructs a two-way fixed effect model to analyze the impact of environmental liability insurance on carbon emissions from both direct and indirect levels. The empirical analysis results show that: at the direct level, the development of environmental liability insurance has the effect of reducing industrial carbon emissions, and its effect is heterogeneous. At the indirect level, the role of environmental liability insurance is weaker in areas with developed financial industry and underdeveloped financial industry. Further heterogeneity analysis shows that in the industrial developed areas, the effect of environmental liability insurance on carbon emissions is more obvious. Based on this, countermeasures and suggestions are put forward from the aspects of expanding the coverage of environmental liability insurance, innovating the development of environmental liability insurance and improving the level of industrialization.}

      abstract={Income inequality has been an important social issue that has attracted widespread attention. Taking the Zero Hunger Program in Brazil as a case study, this study analyzes the impact of policy changes on the income distribution of the Brazilian population during the implementation of the program using a breakpoint regression approach. The data for the study come from a variety of sources, including the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Social Assistance and the Family, and are analyzed using detailed descriptive statistics from the CEIC Brazil In-Depth Database. The results of the study show that during the Lula administration, Brazil's Zero Hunger Program substantially reduced income inequality, provided more substantial income security for the poor, and reduced the income gap between the rich and the poor. In terms of gender differences, the program led to a larger increase in the income of the male labor force at the right age compared to the female labor force, further highlighting the positive impact of the policy on the male labor force. These results are further confirmed by sensitivity analysis and provide useful lessons for subsequent policy formulation. This study's deep dive into the effects of the Zero Hunger program provides a valuable contribution to academic social science research and policy development.}
