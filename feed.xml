Let’s see how linear attention addresses this issue by starting with the standard softmax attention (assuming single head):</p> \[\begin{aligned} \mathrm{Parallel\ training:} &amp;&amp;&amp; \mathbf{O} = \mathrm{softmax}(\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^\top \odot \mathbf{M})\mathbf{V} &amp;&amp;\in \mathbb{R}^{L\times d} \\ \mathrm{Iterative\ inference:} &amp;&amp;&amp;\mathbf{o_t} = \sum_{j=1}^t \frac{\exp(\mathbf{q}_t^\top \mathbf{k}_j)}{\sum_{l=1}^t\exp(\mathbf{q}^\top_t \mathbf{k}_l)}\mathbf{v}_j &amp;&amp;\in \mathbb{R}^d \end{aligned}\] <p>Here,</p> <ul> <li> <p>\(L\) represents sequence length</p> </li> <li> <p>\(d\) represents head dimension</p> </li> <li> <p>\(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}, \mathbf{O} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d}\) represent the query, key, value, and output matrices respectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>\(\mathbf{M} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times L}\) is the causal mask for autoregressive modeling by ensuring each position can only attend to previous positions.</p> </li> </ul> <p>What linear attention<d-cite key="katharopoulos2020transformers"></d-cite> does is to simply remove the softmax operator <d-footnote>The original linear attention formulation incorporates feature mapping on queries and keys along with a normalizer term, but recent studies suggest these components may not be essential.<d-cite key="mao_fine-tuning_2022"></d-cite><d-cite key="sun2023retentive"></d-cite>.</d-footnote>:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \mathrm{Parallel\ training：} &amp;&amp;&amp;\mathbf{O}= (\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^\top \odot \mathbf{M})\mathbf{V} &amp;&amp;\in \mathbb{R}^{L\times d} \\ \mathrm{Iterative\ inference：}&amp;&amp;&amp;\mathbf{o_t} = \sum_{j=1}^t (\mathbf{q}_t^\top \mathbf{k}_j) \mathbf{v}_j &amp;&amp;\in \mathbb{R}^d \end{aligned}\] <p>While removing softmax alone doesn’t immediately reduce computational complexity, it enables a crucial mathematical property: linearity. This property, particularly associativity, allows us to restructure the computations in ways that significantly improve efficiency. For training, researchers have developed <strong>chunkwise parallel</strong> techniques<d-cite key="GAU"></d-cite><d-cite key="sun2023retentive"></d-cite><d-cite key="yang_gated_2023"></d-cite> that leverage this linearity to achieve subquadratic complexity while maintaining hardware efficiency, which forms the foundation of our open-source <strong>flash-linear-attention</strong> library<d-cite key="yang_fla_2024"></d-cite>.</p> <p>For inference, we can also rearrange the computation as follows:</p> <p>\(\begin{aligned} &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\mathbf{o_t} = \sum_{j=1}^t \mathbf{v}_j(\mathbf{k}_j^\top \mathbf{q}_t) &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; (\mathbf{k}_j^\top \mathbf{q}_t) = (\mathbf{q}_t^\top \mathbf{k}_j) \in \mathbb{R}\\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;= (\sum_{j=1}^t\mathbf{v}_j\mathbf{k}_j^\top)\mathbf{q}_t &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\text{By associativity} \end{aligned}\) $$</p> <p>Let’s define a state matrix \(\mathbf{S}_t = \sum_{j=1}^t\mathbf{v}_j\mathbf{k}_j^\top\). Then the computation can be expressed as:</p> \[\mathbf{S}_t = \mathbf{S}_{t-1} + \mathbf{v}_t\mathbf{k}_t^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}, \quad \mathbf{o}_t = \mathbf{S}_t \mathbf{q}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{d}\] <p>This formulation reveals that linear attention is essentially a <strong>linear RNN with a matrix-valued state</strong> \(\mathbf{S}\) that accumulates key-value outer products, enabling efficient state (size) expansion from \(\mathcal{O}(d)\) to \(\mathcal{O}(d^2)\).</p> <details> <summary> Why do we want state expansion?</summary> Traditionally, RNN's hidden dimension is often the same (or of the same magnitude) as the input dimension, due to the expensive matrix-multiply-based state update. However, RNN solely relies on the recurrent state to remember the entire history and state size tends to be the bottleneck to remember sufficient amount of information, especially in retrieval tasks. We've been observing a substantial amount of research investigating hardware-efficient state expansion since Mamba1<d-cite key="Gu2023MambaLS"></d-cite> explicitly pointed it out, and linear attention styled outer-product-based update has proven to be optimal in terms of efficiently scaling state up (Mamba2<d-cite key="mamba2"></d-cite> also adopts this strategy!). In our previous HGRN2 work<d-cite key="qin_hgrn2_2024"></d-cite>, we investigated different approaches for state expansion, and the outer product based mechanism has proven to be both performant and scalable. </details> <p>With this approach, we only need to store and update \(\mathbf{S}_t\) instead of maintaining all previous key-value pairs. This optimization dramatically improves efficiency: the time complexity for autoregressive inference reduces from \(\mathcal{O}(L^2d)\) to \(\mathcal{O}(Ld^2)\), while the space complexity improves from \(\mathcal{O}(Ld)\) to \(\mathcal{O}(d^2)\). These improvements make this method particularly advantageous in two scenarios:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Long sequence modeling</strong> where quadratic complexity of softmax attention could be a significant bottleneck.</p> </li> <li> <p>During <strong>generation</strong>, where computation is usually <strong>memory-bound</strong>, removing the KV cache can significantly enhance <strong>inference latency</strong> for \(L \gg d\).</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="no-free-lunch-key-limitations-of-linear-attention">No Free Lunch: Key Limitations of Linear Attention</h3> <p>Unfortunately, there is no free lunch. The fixed-size state matrix in linear attention means it cannot perfectly preserve all historical information, making exact retrieval particularly challenging.</p> <p>More formally, linear attention implements a key-value associative memory, which is the sum of outer products between keys and values \(\mathbf{S} = \sum \mathbf{v}_i\mathbf{k}_i^\top\). Assuming all keys are normalized to unit length, when we try to retrieve a value associated with a specific key \(k_j\), we get:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \mathbf{S}\mathbf{k}_j &amp;= \sum \mathbf{v}_i (\mathbf{k}_i^\top \mathbf{k}_j) \\ &amp;= \mathbf{v}_j + \underbrace{\sum_{i\neq j} (\mathbf{k}_i^\top \mathbf{k}_j)\mathbf{v}_i}_{\text{retrieval error}} \end{aligned}\] <p>To minimize the retrieval error term, we need \(\mathbf{k}_i^\top \mathbf{k}_j = 0\) for all \(i\neq j\) - in other words, all keys should be <strong>orthogonal</strong> to each other. However, this reveals a fundamental limitation: in a \(d\)-dimensional space, you can only have at most \(d\) orthogonal vectors. This explains why increasing head dimension helps (For example, Sun et al.<d-cite key="sun2023retentive"></d-cite> have demonstrated the necessity of increasing head dimensions to enhance model performance) - it provides more “room” in the vector space for storing distinct key-value pairs!</p> <p>This theoretical limitation manifests in practice: vanilla linear attention has underperformed compared to softmax attention (by a large marghin) in language modeling. The primary cause is memory “overload”: in this key-value associative memory system, we can only add new key-value associations without the ability to erase existing information. As sequences grow longer, this leads to accumulating “retrieval errors” that degrade performance.</p> <blockquote> <p>“The enemy of memory is not time; it’s other memories…” — David Eagleman. h/t to Kazuki Irie for the quote reference</p> </blockquote> <p>Recent advances in gated variants of linear attention (such as GLA<d-cite key="yang_gated_2023"></d-cite> and Mamba<d-cite key="Gu2023MambaLS"></d-cite>) have significantly narrowed the performance gap with standard attention in language modeling tasks by incorporating a <strong>forgetting mechanism</strong>.

Instead of simply accumulating key-value outer product, it updates its state based on prediction errors:</p> \[\begin{align*} \mathbf{S}_{t} &amp;= \mathbf{S}_{t-1} - \beta_t(\mathbf{S}_{t-1} \mathbf{k}_t - \mathbf{v}_t)\mathbf{k}_t^\top \\ &amp;= \mathbf{S}_{t-1} - \beta_t \mathbf{S}_{t-1} \mathbf{k}_t \mathbf{k}_t^\top + \beta_t \mathbf{v}_t \mathbf{k}_t^\top \end{align*}\] <p>The parallel to the Delta Rule becomes clear when we break down the components:</p> <ul> <li>\(\beta_t \in \mathbb{R}\) acts as the learning rate</li> <li>\(\mathbf{k}_t \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is the input data</li> <li>\(\mathbf{v}_t \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is the target</li> <li>\(\mathbf{S}_{t-1} \mathbf{k}_t \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is our current prediction</li> </ul> <p>We will revisit this form later, showing how it can emerge naturally from a single gradient descent step on a (online) loss function.</p> <p>There’s another intuitive way to understand this update rule. Think of \(\mathbf{S}_{t-1}\mathbf{k}_t\) as retrieving the “old value” associated with the current key \(\mathbf{k}_t\) from memory. When we encounter a newly associated value \(\mathbf{v}_t\) for the same key, rather than blindly overwriting, we make a careful update:</p> \[\begin{align*} \mathbf{v}_t^{\text{new}} &amp;= (1-\beta_t) \mathbf{v}_t^{\text{old}} + \beta_t \mathbf{v}_t, \\ \mathbf{S}_t &amp;= \mathbf{S}_{t-1} - \underbrace{\mathbf{v}_t^{\text{old}} \mathbf{k}_t^\top}_{\text{erase}} + \underbrace{\mathbf{v}_t^{\text{new}} \mathbf{k}_t^\top}_{\text{write}} \end{align*}\] <p>where \(\mathbf{v}_t^{\text{new}}\) is a learned combination of the old and current values, controlled by a dynamic \(\beta_t \in (0,1)\): when \(\beta_t=0\), the memory content remains intact, and when \(\beta_t=1\), we completely replace the old associated value with the new one.</p> <h3 id="deltanet-as-a-strong-in-context-learning-rnn">DeltaNet as a Strong In-context Learning RNN</h3> <p>MQAR (Multi-Query Associative Recall)<d-cite key="zoology"></d-cite> is a recent popular synthetic benchmark aimed at measuring the in-context associative recall ability for subquadratic models.</p> <p>The MQAR task works as follows: Each letter is associated with a number, and the model is asked to correctly recall the number associated with each letter in a query sequence.</p> <p>For example, given the input:</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A 4 B 3 C 6 F 1 E 2 → A ?

Associative recall failures are a primary source of errors in subquadratic models and largely account for their perplexity gap relative to softmax attention. Thus, DeltaNet’s perfect MQAR performance suggested significant potential.</p> <p>We’ve also conducted experiments on MAD<d-cite key="poli_mechanistic_2024"></d-cite>, another more comprehensive benchmark than MQAR that is also motivated to test new architecture’s capacities, and the results are summarized below:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th>Compress</th> <th>Fuzzy Recall</th> <th>In-Context Recall</th> <th>Memorize</th> <th>Noisy Recall</th> <th>Selective Copy</th> <th>Average</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Transformer</td> <td>51.6</td> <td>29.8</td> <td>94.1</td> <td>85.2</td> <td>86.8</td> <td>99.6</td> <td>74.5</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hyena</td> <td>45.2</td> <td>7.9</td> <td>81.7</td> <td>89.5</td> <td>78.8</td> <td>93.1</td> <td>66.0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Multihead Hyena</td> <td>44.8</td> <td>14.4</td> <td>99.0</td> <td>89.4</td> <td>98.6</td> <td>93.0</td> <td>73.2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mamba</td> <td>52.7</td> <td>6.7</td> <td>90.4</td> <td>89.5</td> <td>90.1</td> <td>86.3</td> <td>69.3</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GLA</td> <td>38.8</td> <td>6.9</td> <td>80.8</td> <td>63.3</td> <td>81.6</td> <td>88.6</td> <td>60.0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeltaNet</td> <td>42.2</td> <td>35.7</td> <td>100</td> <td>52.8</td> <td>100</td> <td>100</td> <td>71.8</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>where DeltaNet demonstrates its strong in-context recall capacities. These synthetic tasks are inexpensive to run and offer clear evidence that DeltaNet is likely to perform well at scale.
