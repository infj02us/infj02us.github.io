There were many tour groups, and we grabbed a few people to take pictures for us.</p> <p>At 11 a.m., we entered the Palace Museum. Compared to Nanjing Museum, I found the audio guides pretty interesting, though the Palace Museum’s “smart” guide wasn’t that smart — a bit clunky, honestly.</p> <p>The first part of the Palace felt a bit dull — nothing to see inside the halls, no “glorious splendor” to speak of. But when we reached the East and West Six Palaces, it was Xiao Li’s domain. Years of watching *Empresses in the Palace* weren’t for nothing — she knew everything by heart.</p> <p>We even tried afternoon tea at the Palace Museum. One of us clearly has taste bud issues — she found it sickly sweet, I found it flavorless. The lychee and bayberry were tasty, though — officially called... *Fragrant Red Plum Imperial Consort Drink*. I asked Xiao Li if we’d try afternoon tea again — her review: “Not even a dog would eat it.” After that, we continued our palace trek. At every palace, Xiao Li could recite lines from the drama — impressive, truly.</p> <p>We thought we’d finish the Palace Museum tour by 2 p.m., but ended up staying until 4 p.m., leaving no time to visit Beijing Normal University, which was a shame since Professor Zhu helped us make the campus visit reservation yesterday.</p> <p>Leaving the Palace, my legs and brain no longer felt like my own — I’d never been this exhausted. We planned to have a sightseeing bus drop us directly at the subway, but we were left 700 meters away — unbelievable. After a mix of subway and taxi rides, we arrived at the Mathematics Institute where I’ll be spending the next four years. After seeing Tsinghua, Xiao Li thought *Huli* was pitiful, but after seeing the Institute, she thought *Huli* was... not bad after all.</p> <p>We picked a random home-style restaurant for dinner, but since it was nearly time for Xiao Li to leave — and given my poor track record with time — she decided to pack the food right after ordering and headed straight to the train station. Turns out, the only time I estimated correctly was the walking time — we arrived just as the gate was about to close. I thought we’d see each other again soon in Hainan at the end of June, but still couldn’t hold back at the ticket gate.</p> <p>In two days, we slept less than 9 hours, walked 60,000 steps — a military-style tour for sure — but every place we explored and everything we did was pure joy.</p> <p>Rest well. Study hard.
