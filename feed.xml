We visited Hongshan Zoo during off-peak hours — totally worth the ticket price. We saw black bears playing around and all sorts of clever primates. The constant uphill and downhill walks were exhausting. When we got to the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, it was already closed, so we spontaneously decided to walk halfway around Xuanwu Lake instead. The breeze was nice — it would have been perfect if we weren’t bundled up in heavy winter pants. We queued for a Heytea drink — pretty good, but not mind-blowing. We originally planned to eat at Nanjing Impressions, but there were over 200 tables ahead of us, so we switched to a Hangzhou restaurant — also very good.

The roast duck from a roadside stall was also delicious — the chef’s cutting board was worn into a dent. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial was heavy and somber — we left before finishing the visit. Ming Xiaoling wasn’t very interesting, but the free photo before climbing the city wall was a nice touch. Meihua Mountain was beautiful, and it was the first time I saw plum blossoms in my life. After coming down, we spontaneously went to Nanjing Impressions — the Royal Pickled Pepper Chicken was tasty, but the rest of the dishes were similar to the disappointing experience we had in Shanghai.
